# Overview

This extension contains functions for creating healthcheck resources (currently just via a cURL command), to allow local_resources to depend on things such as docker-compose resources.

Please see the [example](./example/Tiltfile) for usage. Functions within the Tiltfile are fully documented if you need any further details.
